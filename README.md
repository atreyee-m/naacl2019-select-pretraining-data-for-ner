This repository has a pytorch (1.0.0) implementation of BiLSTM-CRF model for NER, used in our NAACL paper:

Xiang Dai, Sarvnaz Karimi, Ben Hachey, and Cecile Paris. 2019. Using Similarity Measures to Select Pretraining Data for NER.  In NAACL, Minneapolis, Minnesota.

The codes under utils directory are mainly taken from AllenNLP, and it may contain something not used in this model.
